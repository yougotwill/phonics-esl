## Notes

This project is probably a copyright infringment because Jollyphonics sells it's resources as a CD and has various apps to practice with.
I probably either need to
  1. Email and see if I can get permission to host the resources.
  2. Remove all jolly phonics content and just use example words (not ideal)
  3. Change the project to be about hirgana and katakana and find a free resources.

- [x] get images and sounds
- [x] update phonics.json with first 42 phonics
- [ ] crop all gesture images
- [x] updates phonics.js with all gesture explanations
- [ ] updates phonics.js with all example words
- [x] work out copyright situation for sounds and images.
- [ ] Sort out grid system so it looks clean at different screen sizes like boostrap. Probably should look into css grid.
- [ ] Dark theme toggle.

## Long-term

- [ ] Search bar to filter the phonic cards displayed based on the input
